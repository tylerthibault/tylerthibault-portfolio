-   Protocol 200
    

-   Software designed to track the qty of X parts and pull status of the 3 sample units and the 1 test unit that is the 200th part that we make in a batch. 
    

-   (BLR) Bridge Leg Resistance
    

-   Software designed to take the place of the BLR excel sheet because the new computers are not going to have excel on them.
    
    The BLR software is a specialized engineering tool developed for precise measurement and documentation of bridge leg resistance values in manufacturing environments. This system facilitates the acquisition, validation, and archival of critical electrical resistance measurements across multiple manufacturing stages including pre-cure, post-cure, and post-processing phases. It implements automated data collection through DMM instrumentation integration while supporting manual entry workflows when required. The software correlates resistance readings with specific element identifiers, maintaining measurement traceability through work orders and part numbers. Core functionality includes real-time resistance monitoring, multi-stage measurement comparison, pin location reference diagrams for proper connection verification, and a robust data management structure that ensures measurement integrity throughout the production process. BLR_2 addresses the need for standardized electrical testing procedures in precision component manufacturing where consistent resistance values are essential quality indicators.
    
    SHORT VERSION: Bridge Leg Resistance Software captures, validates, and archives bridge leg resistance across manufacturing stages with full traceability.
    

-   Match Maker 300
    

-   This program scans store inventories to locate parts X and X (elements X and X, calculates each part’s sensitivity across three temperature ranges, identifies compatible matches within drawing-specified tolerances (e.g., 0.15%), automatically pairs them, and presents ready-to-pick lists for shelf retrieval.
    

-   BATHTUB - ELETRIC BOAT
    

-   BATHTUB (Bath Analysis Transducer Harmonization and Temperature Uniformity Benchmark) is a specialized software developed to automate the evaluation of temperature uniformity in a bath testing process. The process involves placing 15 parts and 4 probes in a bath, cycling through 10 temperature steps over the course of a few days, and including a 24-hour burn-in phase. BATHTUB software takes the raw data produced during this process and aligns the part data with the corresponding probe data (with every 4 parts linked to 1 probe). It identifies the plateau of each temperature step for the parts, extracts a representative datapoint, and compares it to the corresponding probe datapoint to ensure the part temperature is within 0.5°F of the probe. This automation significantly streamlines the process, which previously required about an hour of manual effort to analyze a single batch of parts down to just seconds.

-   MegaMaid
    

-   MegaMaid is an Arduino-based program designed to dramatically improve the efficiency of backfilling parts manifolds. The process, which traditionally took around 15 minutes, has been reduced to just 10 seconds with MegaMaid. The program works by pulling a vacuum on the entire manifold unit and then releasing it, allowing oil to replace the negative air in the line, achieving a near-perfect backfill 99% of the time (with no failures observed to date). Unlike traditional software projects, MegaMaid required a combination of coding and hardware assembly, as well as ensuring seamless interaction between the code and the hardware components.
    

-   Website
    

-   This is a concept website for what we could build for RSP Wenatchee if they let us. This would allow for us to have a lot more freedom on what we can do when we are interacting with our clients.
    

-   Test Lead Calibration

-   Hermes
    

-   Hermes is an advanced dispositioning software developed to revolutionize the process of analyzing drift results. By automating the pass/fail disposition process, Hermes reduces the time required to evaluate parts in drift from approximately 1.5 hours to just 30 seconds to a minute. Additional features include saving dispositioned records for traceability and providing intuitive 3-day and 7-day visualizations through Plotly graphs, which help users analyze trends effectively. Hermes is used 2-3 times per week and has become an indispensable tool for ensuring consistency and accuracy in operations.
